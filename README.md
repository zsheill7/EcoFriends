The EcoFriends app allows anyone to sell excess food they have, preventing countless tons of food from going to
waste. Restaurants and producers can post excess food they have for people to pick up, and anyone can purchase
food through the app. The messaging and calendar functions allow sellers and buyers to coordinate pickup times
quickly and easily.
